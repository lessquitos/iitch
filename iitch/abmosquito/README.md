# iitch Agent Based Modeling

This directory contains an agent based model for how a population of mosquitoes move through an environmet, are caught by traps, are born and die.

Please see the notebook Mosquito_ABM_example.ipynb for an example of using the model in a scenario with 20 mosquitoes and 20 traps in the environment. Then, the simulation is run and an animation is generated to see the result.
